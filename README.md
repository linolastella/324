# CSC324H1---W2017
Principles of Programming Languages class I took, Winter 2017

Some Programming Languages paradigms were covered in this class. In particular, we practiced stateless programming.
3 major assignments and 6 exercises.

First assignment -> practice with higher-order functions and anonymous functions (lambda). It's a maze generator and auto-solver, 
                    it requires DrRacket to read the file because it contains images.
                    
Second assignment -> practice with pattern matching and memory model. Interpreter for a subset of Racket.
Third assignment -> practice with static types. A type-inferer.

Exercises are shorter than the assignments and they were often a preparation.

I worked with my friend Kyra Stephen in this course :)
